# Positioning Strategy for Business Benefit

**Goal**: Position Tanwa Arpornthip's personal brand to benefit his ventures (Two Flamingos Capital, SCB 10X advisory, academic work, Flight Notes newsletter)

## The Core Challenge

Academic credentials (H-index, publications, citations) don't translate well to mainstream audiences. Investors and entrepreneurs care about **applications, opportunities, and risks** - not mechanics.

## Unique Differentiators

### 1. The Rare Bridge
- **Physics PhD + Blockchain/AI Expertise + VC Technical Advisor**
- Very few people can evaluate deep tech investments with both academic rigor AND practical startup understanding
- Position: "I've been on both sides - the lab and the deal table"

### 2. The Translation Layer
- Can decode complex tech (quantum physics, blockchain consensus, AI architectures) into investment theses
- Position: "I translate technical complexity into investment clarity"

### 3. Proven Track Record
- 414 citations (academic credibility)
- WikiExpo 2024 Award (industry recognition)
- SCB 10X portfolio (real investment outcomes)
- Published research on DeFi security, flash loans, VRF

### 4. The Practitioner-Academic
- Not ivory tower: actively uses cutting-edge tools (Gas Town, Claude Code)
- Runs tiny AI-augmented teams (Flight Notes theme)
- 2,171 GitHub contributions/year (hands-on builder)

## Strategic Positioning Statements

### For Investors/VCs
> "Senior Technical Advisor who bridges academic rigor with venture capital, specializing in AI and blockchain due diligence. I don't just evaluate tech - I've published on it, built with it, and helped SCB 10X invest in it."

### For Startups Seeking Advisory
> "Physics PhD who speaks both lab and boardroom. I help founders translate deep tech into investor-ready narratives while identifying technical risks before they become expensive."

### For Academic Audiences
> "Blockchain researcher at the intersection of DeFi security and practical applications, with hands-on experience advising one of Southeast Asia's leading VC firms."

### For Newsletter Readers
> "Building tiny, AI-augmented teams that punch like institutions. Weekly dispatches on what actually works when you're small but ambitious."
