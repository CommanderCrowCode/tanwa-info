For someone with your profile — investment, AI, trading, innovation leadership, and public speaking — your personal website should be a strategic credibility surface:

Simple. Memorable. Clean.
A site that positions you as a thought leader and operator.

Below is exactly what you should include.

⸻

🔥 Tanwa Arpornthip — Personal Website Structure

1️⃣ Homepage — Identity and Thesis

Hero Statement (short, bold):

Builder of AI-driven financial and human-capability systems.

Subline:

Founder & investor operating at the intersection of markets, automation, and learning.

Clean CTA options:
	•	Speaking Engagements
	•	Advisory / Projects

Quick credibility anchors:
	•	advisor roles
	•	companies founded
	•	AUM scale goals
	•	key domains (AI, trading, web3, digital transformation)

⸻

2️⃣ Portfolio of Ventures

Show the breadth of what you operate, with crisp cards:
	•	Two Flamingos Capital — crypto market-making & delta-neutral strategies
	•	Flamingo 492 — corporate training + real-estate investments
	•	Lumicello — personalized learning science + AI
	•	Vector — AI-fitness systems (HYROX performance)
	•	Noesis — AI deployment for education operations

Each card:
What problem it solves → what role you play → traction metric / milestone.

⸻

3️⃣ Speaking & Media

You are a keynote-level speaker. Show it:
	•	Topics (AI workflows, digital innovation, trading strategy, emerging tech)
	•	Event list (TMA keynote, SCB10X engagements, etc.)
	•	Highlight reel / showreel (60–120 sec)
	•	Contact CTA

⸻

4️⃣ Essays / Notes / Research

Very important — this positions authority.

Name it something with personality:
	•	Flight Notes ✈️
	•	The Village Papers
	•	Systems for Advantage
	•	Operating Frontier

Write in compact thesis-style posts:
	•	Delta-neutral liquidity as a service
	•	AI as workforce leverage
	•	Market design as competitive advantage
	•	The Curiosity Fingerprint™ model

Even 3–5 strong posts = huge signal.

⸻

5️⃣ Roadmaps & Experiments

This taps into your long-term mindset.
	•	“50-Year Flight Plan” visualized
	•	Current high-conviction experiments
	•	Where you’re placing your chips (ideas & capital)

This is magnetizing for collaborators & LPs.

⸻

6️⃣ Personal Chapter

Not family details — personal edge.
	•	Your athletic program (HYROX Pro, marathon goals)
	•	Your philosophy of leadership & ownership
	•	A subtle touch: “Currently building a bilingual environment at home”
	•	Photos: just 2–3, clean, intentional

Keep private info minimal — but humanize.

⸻

7️⃣ Contact + Ways to Work With You

Direct and useful:
	•	Advisory requests
	•	Speaking inquiries
	•	LP introductions
	•	Select mentoring (if desired)

⸻

🎯 Tone & Aesthetic
	•	Black + White + a single accent (Flamingo or Gold)
	•	Bold typography (e.g. Inter / Söhne / IBM Plex Sans)
	•	Minimal animations
	•	Zero clutter

Think:
Naval Ravikant × Ray Dalio × Founder-Operator

⸻

📌 Priority Messaging Themes for You
	1.	Precision
	2.	Systems Thinking
	3.	Applied Intelligence
	4.	Compounding Craft
	5.	Zero-fluff Operators

Your personality is “calm intensity.”
Your site should feel like that.

⸻

If you’d like, I can:
	•	Draft all page copy fully
	•	Create the visual moodboard + layout wireframes
	•	Package everything into a Next.js / Astro / Eleventy starter
	•	Include SEO + structured metadata for speaking & founder branding

Would you like me to produce:
A) a full content draft?
B) a visual layout first?
C) both at once so you can review and tweak?
